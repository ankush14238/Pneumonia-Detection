This is an ongoing project to develop a model that predicts if a person has pneumonia or not using OpenCV2 and other aspects of Image Analysis. Right now I am just trying to get a baseline performance for the model and will further use other aspects of Image Analysis to increase the precision of the model.
The current model (a simple CNN with data augmentation)achieves an accuracy of 91%
